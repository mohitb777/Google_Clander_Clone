 # Mohit Planner

Mohit Planner is a personal productivity app inspired by Google Calendar. It lets you browse months, drill into your current week, create color-coded events, and keep them stored locally. The UI is built with React 18 and Tailwind CSS.

## Features

- Month and week views with quick navigation controls
- Event creation, editing, deleting, and color labels
- Persistent storage using `localStorage`
- Responsive layout tailored for desktop resolutions

## Tech Stack

- React 18 (Create React App)
- Tailwind CSS + custom configuration
- Day.js for date math

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohitb777/Google_Clander_Clone.git
cd Google_Clander_Clone
npm install
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` to explore the app. Use `npm run build` to produce a production bundle in the `build/` folder.

## Deployment

You can host the `build` folder on any static hosting provider (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, etc.). Update the `homepage` field in `package.json` if you serve the site from a sub-path.
